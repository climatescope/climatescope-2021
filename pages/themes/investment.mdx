# Investment

## Global energy transition investment jumped, despite the pandemic but investors’ attention shifted to developed markets

* Asset financing – the funding of projects and infrastructure – for renewable energy, electrified transport and electrified heat hit $471 billion in 2020. This was up 11% from 2019. Annual volumes have more than doubled since 2013.

* Renewables accounted for 60% of the total, but investment into those technologies – wind and solar, mostly – has remained mostly flat for six years. Asset finance for electrified transport reached nearly $140 billion in 2020, or 29% of the total, up from just $65 billion four years earlier. Electrified heat funding topped $50 billion, up from $45 billion in 2019.

* China, the U.S. and Germany accounted for over half of 2020 investment. China ($144 billion) was nearly a third of the total. The U.S. ($79 billion) followed at 17%, down from $84 billion in 2019. Germany ($27 billion) was 6% of the total.

* The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted investment into developing nations as investors shifted to lower-risk markets. In 2020, wealthier nations accounted for 57% of asset finance for renewables, electrified transport and electrified heating, or $262 billion, up from 41% in 2017. With $195 billion, emerging markets accounted for 43% of the total, down from 53% in 2019 and a peak of 59% in 2017.

* Energy transition asset finance plummeted 10% in 2019-2020 in emerging markets, but jumped 34% in developed countries. Richer nations saw asset finance levels nearly double from 2015-2020, from $136 billion to $262 billion.

## The energy transition investment gap is growing, despite COP26 pledges

* Energy transition investment inequality is widening between developed and developing nations, highlighting the need for expanded international support. Developing nations account for two-thirds of the global energy sector emissions, but recent investment levels are far from sufficient to put them on a sufficient decarbonization pathway.

* In 2020, developed nations recorded over 12 times more investment per MtCO2e emissions from the energy sector than emerging markets, compared to seven times more in 2019. While wealthier nations attracted $53 million for each MtCO2e emissions from the energy sectors, developing markets received just $4.3 million.

## Renewable energy investment jumped 24% in rich nations, but plummeted 9% in emerging markets

* While developed nations saw asset finance for renewable energy projects jump 24%, from $109 billion in 2019 to $136 billion in 2020, emerging markets saw levels fall 9%, from $159 billion to  $145 billion. Investment remains 7% higher in developing nations, but the gap is far smaller than in previous years.

* Wind is the main technology for renewable energy investment in both developed and developing markets, with 51% and 58% of the total, respectively. Solar follows with 44% of the total in developed nations and 37% in emerging markets.

## Clean transport investment reached $500 billion in 2016-2020

* Global asset finance for clean road vehicles and infrastructure totaled $500 billion in 2016-2020. In 2020 alone, the sector attracted $139 billion, up 28% from the previous year and 112% up from 2016.

* Investment into passenger electric vehicles (EV) accounted for 70% of the total over the past five years and 85% in 2020. This is also the fastest growing segment of clean transport investment, with a four-fold growth in five years and a 43% jump from 2019-2020. Electric bus sales were the second biggest segment for clean road transport investment. However, investment in busses has not risen consistently. Funding totaled $21 billion in 2016 and $11 billion in 2020.

## Three countries attracted over half of global electrified heat investment

* The U.S., Japan and China alone accounted for over half of global investment in electrified heat. Together, these countries attracted 55% of global investment over the past decade, and 53% in 2020 investment. The U.S. is the only major market for electrified heat that has seen investment grow every year over the past decade.

* Global investment has doubled over the past decade. Capital flows to electrified installations and companies grew at an average rate of 7% per year and jumped 9% from 2019-2020.
